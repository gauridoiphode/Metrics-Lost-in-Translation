## How It Works


This Business Glossary & KPI Translator tool helps reconcile terminology and KPIs across departments to improve alignment and decision-making. Here's what it does:

1. **Metric Conflicts**: Automatically detects and highlights metrics that have different definitions across teams, and we are categorizing them by severity.(High, Medium and Low). We can filter them based on the severity level.
2. **Business Glossary**: Maintains a central repository of terms with their definitions and equivalent terms across departments.
3. **Report Analyzer**: Uses AI to scan reports and documents for terminology misalignments, flagging potential issues that could lead to miscommunication.
4. **KPI Visualizer**: Provides visual representations of how terms and metrics relate across departments, making it easier to see connections and potential misalignments.


### Key Features

- **Cross-Department Mapping**: Maps equivalent terms between Sales, Marketing, and Product departments
- **Misalignment Detection**: Automatically identifies when different departments are using inconsistent terminology
- **Recommended Resolutions**: Suggests specific ways to resolve each terminology conflict
- **Visual Relationship Mapping**: Shows how terms relate across the organization
- **Severity Classification**: Rates misalignments by potential impact on decision-making
- **Report Analysis**: Scans existing documents to find and flag terminology issues


The tool uses the AI SDK with OpenAI integration to analyze reports and detect misalignments between different departmental terminologies, helping teams communicate more effectively and make better-aligned decisions.
